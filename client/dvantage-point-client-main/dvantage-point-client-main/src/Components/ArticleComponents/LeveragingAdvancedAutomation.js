          </ul>
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <p>
            A banking application using Kubernetes would automatically scale its
            microservices when traffic surges, ensuring that the system remains
            responsive. Combined with Prometheus for monitoring and
            auto-healing, the system would detect issues in real-time and
            initiate corrective actions without manual intervention.
          </p>
          <h4>
            4. Immunity: Achieving Immutable Infrastructure and Application
            Security
          </h4>
          <p>
            Immunity refers to making infrastructure and applications immutable,
            meaning they cannot be changed once deployed, reducing the chances
            of security risks or unintended tampering. Immutable infrastructure
            also ensures that deployments are consistent across environments.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Practices:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Immutable Infrastructure:</h4>
              <p>
                Tools like Packer allow you to build machine images that are
                immutable. Once an image is created, it is deployed as-is, with
                no configuration changes allowed after deployment. This practice
                prevents "configuration drift" and ensures consistency.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Container Security:</h4>
              <p>
                Aqua Security and Sysdig Secure can be integrated with
                containerized environments to enforce security policies, detect
                vulnerabilities, and prevent tampered images from being
                deployed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Zero Trust Architecture:</h4>
              <p>
                Using identity-based access control, tools like HashiCorp Vault
                and Google BeyondCorp enable secure authentication and
                authorization for all services, ensuring that only authenticated
                processes can make changes to the infrastructure or
                applications.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <p>
            A healthcare application that processes sensitive patient data might
            use Packer to create immutable infrastructure, ensuring no
            configuration changes are made after deployment. Security tools like
            Aqua Security would scan containers to ensure they are secure, and
            HashiCorp Vault would handle secrets management, ensuring that only
            authorized processes access sensitive data.
          </p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Leveraging advanced automation tools to achieve Agility, Error-Free
            Releases, Resiliency, and Immunity is no longer a luxuryâ€”it's a
            necessity for organizations seeking to stay competitive. By
