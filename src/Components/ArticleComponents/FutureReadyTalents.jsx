          <h5>AI as a Portal to New Perspectives:</h5>
          <p>
            The true promise of AI in education lies not in its ability to
            replicate human intelligence, but in its potential to inspire a new
            level of human creativity and inquiry. As futurist Roy Amara
            posited, we tend to overestimate the short-term impact of technology
            and underestimate its long-term effects. The immediate concerns
            about AI replacing jobs or facilitating academic dishonesty, while
            valid, should not overshadow the profound, long-term opportunities
            for human advancement.
          </p>

          <p>
            The World Economic Forum has identified critical future skills such
            as analytical thinking, innovation, and continuous
            learning—abilities that are not tied to any specific academic
            subject but are essential for navigating an increasingly complex
            world. AI can be a powerful partner in developing these skills,
            pushing us to ask deeper questions, observe the world from new
            perspectives, and ultimately, to define and solve the grand
            challenges of our time. In the words of Marcel Proust, the real
            voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in
            having new eyes. AI, in its highest form, offers us these new eyes.
