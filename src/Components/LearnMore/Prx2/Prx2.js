                Independent of nature of project “Greenfield” or “Migration”, functional and non-functional assessments are MUST going through tollgates and checkpoints of production readiness . Whether it is a digital service deployment in telecom or financial or e-commerce space, maintaining balance between quality and time to market is always a debate. The list of functional requirements remains big and while you are intended to inherit all required non-functional aspects, investment of people and process become immutable and you start creating heat-map of priorities.
